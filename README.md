# Learning With AI CSC 494 - Mitchell Playforth

## Learning Goals
- Use AI to learn how to set up a Docker container running a web application
- Use AI to learn how to create a sliding door mechanism with a motor controlled by an arduino board.

## Reasoning
- The most experience I have had with Docker is setting up a Minecraft server on it. I have not made an actual application to run off Docker until now. As I have specific questions about how Docker works I will ask them to AI. Also, after performing my own root-cause analysis, I will ask AI for solutions to issues that come up.
- I have no experience with electrical engineering. While I plan on using YouTube as my starting resource, I will use AI as specific questions come up during this process.
